### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing a **B.S. Computer Science** at **George Washington University** in Washington, DC in the School of Engineering and Applied Science. I am interested in pursuing a career in **cybersecurity in the government and defense industry**.

My industry experience includes cross-training with both Windows and Linux OSes, working in an Agile DevSecOps model, becoming familiar with security-relevant tools and cybersecurity protocols, utilizing virtual test environments to conduct research and development, and learning the fundamentals of networking, scripting, and security. I always challenge myself to continuously learn and problem-solve as I navigate new concepts, skills, and tools. I believe the combination of my course curriculum and experience in the industry has given me a comprehensive viewpoint and knowledge base, and I am excited to continue to grow and pursue a career in cybersecurity.

*Specific Areas of Interest: Penetration Testing, Offensive Security, Cyber Warfare, Research and Analytics, Software Engineering, Digital Forensics*
